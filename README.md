Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.

Customer Segmentation for Retail Store Using K-Means Clustering

I recently worked on a project analyzing customer purchase data to segment them into distinct groups based on their behavior. Using the K-Means clustering algorithm, I identified patterns that can help businesses better target their audience and optimize marketing strategies.

Key Insights:

- Customer Clusters: Segmented customers into distinct groups, such as high spenders, budget-conscious shoppers, and average buyers.
- Spending Patterns: Discovered how spending scores and annual income influence purchase behavior.
- Optimal Clusters: Applied the Elbow method to determine the ideal number of clusters, enhancing segmentation accuracy.
- Strategic Applications: These insights can support personalized promotions and improve customer engagement.

Visualization Techniques:
- Scatter Plots to illustrate customer clusters based on spending scores and annual income.
- Elbow Method Plot to visualize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) and find the optimal cluster count.

This project showcases the ability of machine learning algorithms to transform raw data into actionable business insights.
